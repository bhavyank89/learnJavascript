        Fetch is a new way for making HTTP request.<br>
        It supports promises and hence prevent callback hells<br>
        fetch( "url" ); = fetch is an inbuit function which expects a url as an argument and return
        a promise.
        <br>
        but..........<br>
        whenever fetch is executed with a url it returns response as soon as headers are fetched<br>
        and we do not get the responseText with it.<Br><br>
        To get back the responseText of the data we again apply a method to the response we got earlier as <br>
        response.json() this method also returns a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
        A third way of HTTP request is by using a third party library called AXIOs<br>
        AXIOs is a library for making HTTP request<br>
        AXIOs uses fetch in their backend for making HTTP request
