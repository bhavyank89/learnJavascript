    <p>Javascript is single Threaded which means JS can perform single task at a
        time.
        when there is a task for setting timeOut from setTimeOut or a server
        request, JS does not stop at that point instead it pass on the task to browser
        which reminds JS whenever the data from server is feteched.In a meanwhile
        JS continues the execution of the other instruction.

        browser comes with web API's that are able to handle certain task in the background
        (like making request or timeOut)
